This repository contains links to relevant software from our paper.

Our paper proposes a new approach for reconstructing patient-specific lung and airway geometries from a 2D X-ray image. This relies on a statistical shape and appearance model (SSAM) from a set of 3D lung shapes and digitally reconstructed radiographs (based on the CT data). We have released a package ```pyssam``` to facilitate other SSAM studies.
